# ETHIndia 2018 hackathon guidelines

# Possible tasks
* The best is to build some end-to-end encrypted multi-user app which _you_ think is the best to build using NuCypher;
* Enabling NuCypher to do conditional policies (e.g. on payment, if `1` is returned by a solidity method etc). This will require understanding of [NuCypher source code](https://github.com/nucypher/nucypher);
* Making a UI for staking. This requires understanding [token issuance model](https://blog.nucypher.com/nucypher-staking-economics-a7bb56b20716). If you have time, you may look at the [smart contracts](https://github.com/nucypher/nucypher/blob/master/nucypher/blockchain/eth/sol/source/contracts/MinersEscrow.sol) which control the staking parameters and their corresponding Python wrappers.

Still, the best is to work on something which _you_ think is the best to work on. Be it decentralized e2e encrypted group chat, or an app to share your medical data, or maybe something we cannot even think of yet!
